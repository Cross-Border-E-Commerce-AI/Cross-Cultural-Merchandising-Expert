## Introduction
Amid accelerating integration of global e-commerce markets, **cross-cultural product selection** has emerged as a core challenge for businesses expanding internationally. Emerging markets such as Southeast Asia exhibit complex characteristics, including linguistic fragmentation (*Indonesian, Thai, etc.*), interwoven religious taboos (*e.g., Islamic Halal certification*), and cultural cognitive disparities (*Hofstede‚Äôs cultural dimension gaps*). Traditional recommendation systems often trigger compliance risks and user aversion due to insufficient cultural sensitivity. Existing research suffers from technological gaps in capturing **cross-modal cultural signals** and **modeling dynamic cultural contexts**, resulting in product selection strategies that struggle to adapt to rapidly evolving consumer psychology.

This research proposes an ‚Äã**‚Äã"AI-Driven Cross-Cultural Commodity Expert"** framework‚Äã‚Äã, which addresses three critical technical bottlenecks through synergistic innovations in **multilingual sentiment analysis**, **cultural quantification engines**, and **dynamic knowledge graphs**:

1. [**Cross-cultural topic clustering model**](#1cross-cultural-social-media-sentiment-analysis-bert--topic-clustering‚Äã) :
Combines `XLM-RoBERTa` with `LDA` and embeds a cultural-sensitive word weighting mechanism (*e.g., 3x weight gain for "Halal" in Indonesia*).

2. [**‚Äã‚ÄãDynamic cultural metric matrix**](#2-cultural-dimension-quantification-engine‚Äã) :
Based on *Hofstede‚Äôs cultural dimensions*, establishes a gradient-boosted decision tree (`GBDT`) mapping between cultural distance and consumer behavior (R¬≤).

3. [**‚ÄãTimeSformer-enhanced cross-modal alignment system**](#3-commodity-knowledge-graph-construction‚Äã) :
Integrates religious symbol detection (`YOLOv5`), Ramadan cycle signal injection, and cultural attention mechanisms. Empirical results demonstrate a 27.6% improvement in product selection accuracy on Shopee‚Äôs Southeast Asian market and an 83.2% reduction in cultural conflict incidents.
